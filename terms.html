							<p>

								1. In these terms and conditions (hereinafter collectively referred to as ‘Conditions’):

1.1 ‘Contract’ means any contracts made between the BSAVA and you for the sale and purchase of Products from its Website.

1.2 ‘Order’ means the Products which you have selected to purchase in your online basket.

1.3 ‘Parties’ mean the BSAVA and you.

1.4 ‘Products’ mean any product, article and/or item which the BSAVA sells on its Website. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not include any services e.g. courses or membership subscription.

1.5 ‘Website’ means www.bsava.com or variations to the name of the aforesaid domain name.

1.6 In these Conditions, references to any statute or statutory provision shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be construed as a reference to that statute or statutory provision as from time to time amended, consolidated, modified, extended, re-enacted or replaced.

1.7 In these Conditions, references to the masculine include the feminine and the neuter and to the singular include the plural and vice versa as the context admits or requires.

1.8 In these Conditions headings will not affect the construction of these Conditions.

1.9 You agree that email can be used as a long-distance means of communication.
							</p>
							<h2 class="m-n">2.TERMS OF ACCEPTANCE</h2>
							<p>2.1 A Contract is formed between you and the BSAVA when (and not before) the BSAVA notifies you by email and/or electronically that your Order has been accepted. Your Order will not be accepted until the BSAVA receives authorisation of your credit card payment or such other authorisation. The BSAVA will not accept Orders from you if your address is not within the United Kingdom unless otherwise agreed by an authorised representative of the BSAVA and subject to such additional terms as may be agreed by such authorised representative and you. The BSAVA reserves the right not to accept any Order. You are advised to print off and keep safe a copy of these Conditions once your Order has been accepted by the BSAVA.

								2.2 The Parties agree that the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 shall not apply in any Contracts.
								
								2.3 Subject to any relevant laws and regulation, you agree that these Conditions shall be the exclusive basis on which any Contracts made between the BSAVA and you are transacted and processed unless otherwise agreed in writing by an authorised representative of the BSAVA.
								
								2.4 While the BSAVA tries to ensure that all prices on the Website are accurate, errors may occur. If an error is discovered in the price of the Products that you have ordered, the BSAVA will contact you to let you know the correct price and ask you whether you still wish the BSAVA to fulfill your Order at correct price. The BSAVA shall be under no obligation to fulfill your Order for a Product, which was advertised at an incorrect price. The BSAVA shall give you the option of confirming the Order at the correct price or if you so choose, to cancel the Order altogether. Where you cancel your Order for which you have already paid for, the BSAVA will refund the full amount to you.
								
								2.5 The British Small Animal Veterinary Association will do its best to correct errors and omissions as quickly as practicable after being notified of them.
								
								2.6 The BSAVA will not keep details of your personal or credit or debit cards as its secure payment-processing provider processes them. You undertake that all details you provide to the BSAVA for the purpose of processing the purchase of your Products are correct, that the credit or debit card you are using is your own, and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the Products</p>

							<h2 class="m-n">3.PRICE AND PAYMENT</h2>
							<p>3.1 Subject to Clause 2.4, the price of the ordered Products shall be as set out on the Website, and includes postage, packing and value added tax (if applicable). Unless otherwise agreed by the BSAVA, all payments made by cheque must be in pounds Sterling. For your own protection, please do not send payment in cash.

								3.2 Where Orders are made through the Website, the BSAVA accepts payment through Visa and Master Card (collectively as ‘Credit Cards’) and Switch. 
								
								3.3 No payment for the Products shall be deemed to have been received until the BSAVA has received cleared funds.</p>

							<h2 class="m-n">4.DELIVERY</h2>
							<p>4.1 The BSAVA aims to arrange shipment of all ‘in stock’ items within 1 working day of receiving your Order. Your Order may be delayed if the item is not in stock with the BSAVA’s suppliers. Some items may be unavailable and the current stock status is approximate.

								4.2 Unless a longer delivery date is agreed between the Parties, if the BSAVA fails to dispatch any ordered Products within 30 days of acceptance of your Order, the BSAVA shall refund in full your payment in respect of such Products.
								
								4.3 You agree that risk of loss or damage of Products passes to you upon delivery of the Products or on the date of the first attempted delivery by the BSAVA.
								
								4.4 Please note that your Products may be sent to you in instalments. You may cancel your entire Contract if subsequent instalments forming part of your order are not delivered by the BSAVA.
								
								4.5 If your delivery address is outside the United Kingdom, you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Any such additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you. You should note that customs policies vary widely from country to country; the BSAVA advises each of its customers to contact their local customs office for further information.
								
								4.6 Please note that when shipping Products internationally, you should be aware that cross-border shipments are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities.
								
								4.7 For Christmas Deliveries, the BSAVA recommend that you order by the 18th December. The BSAVA will endeavour to despatch all ‘in stock’ orders within 24 hours, however the BSAVA cannot guarantee delivery on or before the 24th December as the post may be delayed in your area.</p>
